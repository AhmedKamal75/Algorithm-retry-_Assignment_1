# Median of Medians and Randomized Selection Algorithms

This project implements the Median of Medians and Randomized Selection algorithms in Java. These algorithms are used to find the `i-th` smallest element in an unsorted array in linear time.

## Files

- `MOMSelectors.java`: This class implements the Median of Medians algorithm.
- `RandomSelectors.java`: This class implements the Randomized Selection algorithm.
- `Main.java`: This class contains the main method which benchmarks the performance of the two algorithms and prints the results.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `.java` files.
3. Compile all your `.java` files using the `javac` command: javac *.java
4. Run your program with a command-line argument using the `java` command: java Main 1000000

In this example, `1000000` is the `maxArrayLength` passed as a command-line argument. You can replace it with any integer you want.

Please note that these commands assume that you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine and that it's properly # configured in your system's PATH.
